# CODEALPHA_TASKS
This is the first Task of internship of Code Alpha, Using machine learning to find out users music recommendations algorithm, using spotipy WEB API.

Explanation:

Libraries: 
pandas (imported as pd) for data manipulation and analysis
spotipy for interacting with the Spotify API
SpotifyClientCredentials for authenticating with the Spotify API
train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection for splitting data into training and testing sets
RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble for training a random forest classification model
accuracy_score and classification_report from sklearn.metrics for evaluating the performance of the model

I set up the Spotify API credentials by defining the client_id and client_secret variables. These credentials are used to authenticate with the Spotify API. The SpotifyClientCredentials object is created with these credentials, and an instance of the Spotify class is created with this object. This instance, sp, will be used to interact with the Spotify API.

The function, collect_user_song_interactions, takes a user_id as input and returns a list of user-song interactions. Here's what the function does:

.retrieves the user's playlists using the user_playlists method of the Spotify instance.
.initializes an empty list interactions to store the user-song interactions.
.iterates over each playlist and retrieves the tracks in the playlist using the playlist_tracks method.
.iterates over each track and extracts the song ID and user ID.
.appends the user-song interaction (a tuple of user ID and song ID) to the interactions list.
.it returns the interactions list.

The code splits the user-song interaction matrix into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection. The X variable represents the feature matrix, and the y variable represents the target variable (which doesn't exist in the original code). The test_size parameter is set to 0.2, which means that 20% of the data will be used for testing, and the remaining 80% will be used for training.
